I pushed the zip of my public folder to GitHub because I could not update cloudways for the life of me and the folder was too big to upload on portal 

I'd like to let you know about a few issues I came across:

1. Text Color: I tried to make all the text the same blue color, but there was a strange styling issue that prevented me from customizing the color as I wanted.
2. Updates Section: On the homepage, I have an "Updates" section. The first post works well, but I wanted to remove the option to leave comments. When I did this for a test post and clicked "Read More," it oddly took me to the Awards page.
3. Awards Page Navigation: Also, when you try to go to the Awards page from the menu, you get a 404 error, even though the link seems right. The only way to reach the Awards page is by hitting "Read More" on the test post.
4. I did not include the Itineraries on this version but will if I decide to keep going with this site
